 * Bones Scripts File

 * This file should contain any js scripts you want to add to the site.
 * Instead of calling it in the header or throwing it inside wp_head()
 * this file will be called automatically in the footer so as not to
 * slow the page load.
 *
 * There are a lot of example functions and tools in here. If you don't
 * need any of it, just remove it. They are meant to be helpers and are
 * not required. It's your world baby, you can do whatever you want.

/*
 * Here's an example so you can see how we're using the above function
 *
 * This is commented out so it won't work, but you can copy it and
 * remove the comments.
 *
 *
 *
 * If we want to only do it on a certain page, we can setup checks so we do it
 * as efficient as possible.
 *
 * if( typeof is_home === "undefined" ) var is_home = $('body').hasClass('home');
 *
 * This once checks to see if you're on the home page based on the body class
 * We can then use that check to perform actions on the home page only
 *
 * When the window is resized, we perform this function
 * $(window).resize(function () {
 *
 *    // if we're on the home page, we wait the set amount (in function above) then fire the function
 *    if( is_home ) { waitForFinalEvent( function() {
 *
 *      // if we're above or equal to 768 fire this off
 *      if( viewport.width >= 768 ) {
 *        console.log('On home page and window sized to 768 width or more.');
 *      } else {
 *        // otherwise, let's do this instead
 *        console.log('Not on home page, or window sized to less than 768.');
 *      }
 *
 *    }, timeToWaitForLast, "your-function-identifier-string"); }
 * });
 *
 * Pretty cool huh? You can create functions like this to conditionally load
 * content and other stuff dependent on the viewport.
 * Remember that mobile devices and javascript aren't the best of friends.
 * Keep it light and always make sure the larger viewports are doing the heavy lifting.
