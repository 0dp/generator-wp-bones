```

Finally, initiate the generator. run this command in
a working WordPress installations *themes* directory:

## Known Issues

* ~~Theme author info is never stored~~ Thanks to [oldlastman](https://github.com/oldlastman) 

## TODO


*   ~~Instead of having the Bones Wordpress starter theme living in a folder in templates it would be nice to 'fetch' (dunno if this is the right term because i'm still a noob at git) it fresh from it's repo here at git. I have already included simple-git into the generator so it just need to be setup right.~~ Thanks to [iam4x](https://github.com/iam4x) 
*   Convince my girlfriend to get a second cat
