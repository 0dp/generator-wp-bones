# generator-wp-bones

A WordPress theme [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator, to kickstart your [WordPress Bones
theme development](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) with yo, sass and grunt.

**Note:** Still in development


## Getting Started (for when it is published official)


~~Install generator-wp-bones from npm:~~

```
$ npm install -g generator-wp-bones
```

~~Finally, initiate the generator. run this command in
a working WordPress installations *themes* directory:~~

```
$ yo wp-bones
```

## Known Issues

I just wrote this up and there is some minor issues.

I have failed to kill these warnings

```
npm WARN package.json package@0.0.0 No description
npm WARN package.json package@0.0.0 No repository field.
npm WARN package.json package@0.0.0 No README data
```

## TODO


*   Instead of having the Bones Wordpress starter theme living in a folder in templates it would be nice to 'fetch' (dunno if this is the right term because i'm still a noob at git) it fresh from it's repo here at git. I have already included simple-git into the generator so it just need to be setup right. 
*   Convince my girlfriend to get a second cat
